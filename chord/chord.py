# 'key' refers to a 'chord_x...' array which stores different formations
# of chords eg. Maj = 0, 4, 7  ... Min = 0, 3, 7 etc.

# Middle C is at 5 octaves in. Octave integer is multiplied by 12 to
# define the root note of the chord.

# So calling playChord(4, 0, 5) would send MIDI message for E major in
